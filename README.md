Three simple administrative tasks and one reading.

#### Tasks

1. If you haven't already done it, accept the email that you received from Piazza to join the class [Piazza forum](https://piazza.com/class/ke7uxpkwqw643p); 

2. Please take a short [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SRNT3BG) if you haven't already done so;

3. Join the course GitHub organization BC-CSCI1103. In order to join this organization, you'll need a GitHub account, sign up if you don't already have one, it's free. When you join GitHub, you'll create a unique GitHub ID. For the purposes of this course, ***you are required*** to set the  **Name** field of your GitHub account to your full name as specified in the BC system. E.g., my name is "Robert Muller" (and my GitHub ID is "dogfishbar"). Note no middle initial is required for your name entry. The **Name** field is found from **Settings**

    (You won't receive much credit for this first problem set unless you set that correctly.) Once you've joined GitHub, email your GitHub ID to me. The Subject line of your email should have **exactly**:

    ```
    Subject: csci1103: your-github-user-ID
    ```

    The body of the email message can be anything you like. You'll subsequently receive an invitation to join the BC-CSCI1103 GitHub organization. You must **accept that invitation** by the deadline.
